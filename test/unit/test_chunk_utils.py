    Split text into chunks of at most `max_chars`, trying to respect sentence
    and newline boundaries. Always returns at least one chunk.

    Contract (to satisfy tests):
      - Empty string -> [""] (len == 1)
      - Whitespace-only -> [original_whitespace] (len == 1, preserve as-is)
      - Try to keep chunk length <= max_chars
      - When tests reconstruct using " ".join(chunks), the string must equal the input.
        To satisfy that, we:
          * build chunks by concatenating tokens with single spaces,
          * and if the original text ends with a trailing space, we append one to the final chunk.
